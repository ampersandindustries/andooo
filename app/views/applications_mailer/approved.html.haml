        Hi #{@user.name},

      %p
        We're thrilled to invite you to join us this August 12-14 for AndConf 2016!
        We can't wait to see you.

      = render "scholarship_notification", user: @user

      %p
        %b Action Required: Complete your registration in the next 10 days

      - cta = @user.is_scholarship ? "confirm your attendance" : "purchase your ticket"
      %p
        As soon as possible, please #{ link_to "log in", login_url } and
        #{ link_to cta, new_attendances_url }.
        You'll complete a short form with logistical questions like dietary
        restrictions, badge info, and travel & housing preferences.
        If you don't confirm your attendance within 10 days, we'll offer your spot
        to someone on the waitlist.
      %p
        (If you can no longer attend, there's an option #{ link_to "to decline your spot", new_attendances_url }, which will allow us to offer a spot to someone on the waitlist.)

      = render "travel_stipend_explainer", user: @user

        %b Questions?

      %p
        As always, #{ link_to "the FAQ", details_url } is a great source of information
        about AndConf. If you can't find something there, feel free to email us.
