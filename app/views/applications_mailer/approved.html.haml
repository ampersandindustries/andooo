        Hi #{@user.name},

      %p
        We're thrilled to invite you to join us this August 12-14 for AndConf 2016 for a weekend of programming,
        feminism, friendship, and plenty of fireside announcements!

      = render "scholarship_notification", user: @user

      %p
        %b Super Important: please #{ link_to "complete your registration", new_attendances_url } in the next 10 days.

      - cta = @user.is_scholarship ? "confirm your attendance" : "purchase your ticket"
      %p
        As soon as possible, please #{ link_to "log in", login_url } and
        #{ link_to cta, new_attendances_url }.
        You'll complete a short form with logistical questions like dietary
        restrictions, badge info, and travel & housing preferences.
        If you don't confirm your attendance within 10 days, we'll offer your spot
        to someone on the waitlist.
      %p
        If you confirm your attendance <i>sooner</i>
        than 10 days, the organizers will have lower blood pressure and a lasting
        appreciation for your wisdom and stylishness.
      %p
        (If you can no longer attend, there's an option #{ link_to "to decline your spot", new_attendances_url },
        which will allow us to offer a spot to someone on the waitlist.)

        %b Questions?

      %p
        As always, #{ link_to "the FAQ", details_url } is a great source of information
        about AndConf. If you can't find something there, feel free to email us.
