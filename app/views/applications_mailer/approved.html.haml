        Hi #{@user.name}!

      %p
        You've been accepted to attend AndConf 2016! We can't wait to see you in August.

      - if @user.is_scholarship
        %p
          We're also happy to offer you a scholarship ticket to AndConf this year.

      %p
        As soon as possible, please #{ link_to "log in", login_url } and #{ link_to "confirm your attendance", new_attendances_url }.
        There's a short form with logistical questions like dietary restrictions, and travel and housing preferences.
        - if !@user.is_scholarship
          Then, you'll purchase your ticket and will be all set for the conference.

      %p
        (If you can no longer attend, there's an option #{ link_to "to decline your spot", new_attendances_url }, which will allow us to offer a spot to someone on the waitlist.)

      %p
        If you don't confirm your attendance within 10 days, we'll offer your spot to someone on the waitlist.

      %p
        As always, if you have any questions, email the organizers at #{ mail_to MEMBERSHIP_EMAIL }.

      %p
        All the best,
