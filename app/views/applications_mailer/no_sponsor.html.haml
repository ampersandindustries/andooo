      Hi #{@user.name},
    %p
      Your application has been open for two weeks and doesn't yet have a sponsor.
    %p
      Along with submitting an application, a qualification for membership is that you've met at least one member who is willing to say you seem like a reasonable potential member (such as that you'd respect the #{ link_to "base assumptions", BASE_ASSUMPTIONS_URL }, #{ link_to "anti-harassment policy", POLICIES_URL }, and responsibilities of being a member). Please come to events to meet some of us! Or if you'd prefer a quieter opportunity to meet just a couple members over a cup of tea, email #{ mail_to INFO_EMAIL } and we'll set this up.
    %p
      Feel free to email #{ mail_to INFO_EMAIL } if you have any questions.
    %p
      All the best,
      %br/
