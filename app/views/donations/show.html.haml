  %h2 We're looking for sponsors!

  %p
    We are seeking sponsors to offset venue, food, lodging, and transportation costs, so
    that a more diverse group of engineers can participate.
  %p
    Full-price tickets will be sold for $350 each, which will cover three nights of
    lodging and eight meals at St. Dorothy's Rest, as well as transportation from
    downtown San Francisco to the venue!
  %p
    Sponsorship money will be used to decrease the overall cost of tickets as well as
    provide several full-scholarship tickets and travel stipends to a diverse group of
    attendees who might not otherwise be able to make it to AndConf.

  %p
    For more details about the benefits of sponsorship, take a gander at our
    #{ link_to "sponsorship prospectus", "/andconf_prospectus.pdf", target: "_blank" }.

  %p
    If you want to support AndConf but don't have the budget to be an official sponsor, we'd love to
    have you as a friend of AndConf! If you give over $100, we'll be in touch via email to ask if you'd
    like to be listed on our site as such.
