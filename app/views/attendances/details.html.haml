%h3 Travel

%p
  AndConf provides a free shuttle from downtown San Francisco to St. Dorothy's Rest, which is about 2.5 hours
  from downtown San Francisco in normal traffic. If you would rather coordinate carpooling with other attendees,
  there is a #{ link_to "carpool coordination Google doc", CARPOOL_DOC, target: "_blank"} and a #transportation
  #{ link_to "Slack channel", TRANSIT_SLACK_CHANNEL, target: "_blank"} to help you facilitate.

%p
  The carpool doc is public (but only easily findable with the link), so please keep that in mind when including your contact information.

%p
  The shuttle leaving for AndConf will depart at
  %b 3pm on Friday, August 12th
  from a location TBA in downtown SF. We'll let you know the specific location once we've rented some metered spots from the city.

%p
  There are two shuttles back from AndConf, one at
  %b 8pm on Sunday, August 14th,
  after dinner, and the second at
  %b 10am on Monday, August 15th.
  We need to book our the shuttles in advance, so please choose wisely! The shuttle will drop off near a Bart station in downtown SF.
