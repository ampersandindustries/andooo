  %h2 Thanks for attending!
  %p
    Huge thanks to our attendees and sponsors who helped make AndConf 2015 a
    success. If you're interested in hearing about AndConf 2016, sign up for our
    #{link_to "mailing list", "http://eepurl.com/bAuGZb"}.

  %h2 What is AndConf?
  %p
    AndConf (formerly &:conf) is a code retreat and an
    unconference for intersectional feminist programmers in the woods of western
    Sonoma County, CA. Saturday’s code retreat will
    be a day of pair programming on one kata where each hour we throw our
    code away and work with a new person. Sunday’s unconference will have
    two tracks: yak and hack, where we'll talk about technologies,
    programming, careers, and culture.
  %p
    AndConf will take place at
    #{ link_to "St. Dorothy's Rest", "http://stdorothysrest.org/facilities/grounds/" }
    camp and retreat center.
