  %h2 What is AndConf?
  %p
    AndConf (formerly &:conf) is a code retreat and
    unconference for intersectional feminist programmers in the woods of western
    Sonoma County, CA. Saturday’s code retreat will
    be a day of pair programming on one kata where each hour we throw our
    code away and work with a new person. Sunday’s unconference will have
    two tracks: yak and hack, where we'll talk about technologies,
    programming, careers, and culture.
  %p
    AndConf takes place at
